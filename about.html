                        <p>DaMaC was founded by Mr. Dan Magandazi during the challenging days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our first outreach took place on April 21st, 2021, when we distributed COVID-19 relief to over 20 families and provided essential clothing to more than 40 children at Katubwe Gospel Church in Wakiso, Uganda.</p>

                        <h3>Continued Growth & Outreach</h3>
                        <p>DaMaC returned to Katubwe Village to host a clothing donation event that benefited over 80 children. With the support of generous donors, the charity provided new and gently used clothing to these children, many of whom had never experienced the joy of receiving new garments from abroad.</p>

The day continued with a friendly football match between the DaMaC team and Bbanda community residents, and included the donation of footballs to the PAXX Soccer Academy. Later that day, clothing was distributed to over 500 residents of the Bbanda community.</p>

                    "Greetings all, I am deeply grateful and humbled as I reflect on the journey of DaMaC and the incredible milestones we've achieved since establishment. The inspiration to establish a hope foundation came to me during the challenging days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. It was a time when everyone needed hope to live. At that time, my parents, Pastor Dan and Rose Magandazi, supported and encouraged me to reach out to the people in Katubwe village, providing COVID relief and clothing to those in need. That first outreach became the seed that grew into what DaMaC Organization is today.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2023, I was blessed to welcome my long-time friend, Mr. Kiryowa Deo, as my co-founder. Together, with the unwavering commitment of our team of volunteers, we have built a foundation dedicated to inspiring hope and bringing positive change to our communities in Uganda.
                    <br><br>
                    I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our official partners Sipimo Foundation from China and Divine Grace Empowerment Inc (DGE) from the USA for their invaluable support. Your generosity has been instrumental in helping us grow.
                    <br><br>
                    On a personal note, I am overjoyed to share that DaMaC officially registered and was certified by the Uganda Registration Services Bureau on September 18th, 2024. Along with this significant achievement, our organization's name was changed from Dan Hope Foundation (DHF) to Dan Magandazi Charity Organization (DaMaC org), which truly reflects the essence of our mission.
                    <br><br>
                    I am also incredibly grateful to my friends and colleagues who played a key role during the clothing donation drive in Dubai, your generous efforts have made a tremendous impact to the community we serve. I am proud of the difference we've made together and I give thanks to God for connecting me with such amazing friends and partners who share and support the vision behind this charity.
                    <br><br>
                    Again, I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the dedicated DaMaC team of executive directors and volunteers. Your passion and commitment make everything we do possible and continues to drive our mission forward. I am incredibly proud of how far we've come and the hundreds of lives we've touched. Seeing DaMaC inspiring hope in communities is more fulfilling than I ever dreamed possible. Together, we are building a future where hope and compassion inspire lasting change in Uganda.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you to everyone who has supported this journey. With your continued dedication, I am excited for the future of DaMaC and the opportunity we have to inspire hope together, the best is yet to come."
